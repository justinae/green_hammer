		<p class="no_margin"><strong>President &amp; Founder</strong></p>
		<p class="no_margin"><strong>Certified Passive House Consultant</strong></p>
		<p>Equal parts talented craftsman and business entrepreneur, Stephen has guided the maturity of Green Hammer Inc. from a sole proprietorship into a flourishing small multi-faceted corporation with twenty-five plus staff.  At Green Hammer, he is involved with all projects and is likely to be the first face to greet you when you begin the building process.</p>
		<p>Stephen founded Green Hammer Inc, in the winter of 2002, bringing with him an extensive working knowledge and expertise in a diversity of trades. Stephen's life before Green Hammer included a degree in Community Development and Applied Economics from the University of Vermont, time as a Financial Analyst for an organic chocolate importer and even the Sustainability Coordinator for a 1200-acre organic Agro-Tourismo in Italy.</p>
		<p>Stephen's business philosophies are oriented toward developing economic clout for individuals and local companies working towards a framework of sustainable business practices. Much of his time outside the office is dedicated to the non-profit and government boards that he is involved with, which work to advance the local market for green building and combat global climate change. These include: the <a href="http://www.buildlocalalliance.org/" target="_blank">Build Local Alliance</a>, which he co-founded in 2005 as a non-profit focusing on making market connections in the local Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified forest market to facilitate the flow of local FSC forest products to local building project; the Western Columbia Chapter of the <a href="http://www.ecobuilding.org/" target="_blank">Northwest EcoBuilding Guild</a>, where Stephen has served as the committee chair since January of 2008.

		<p class="no_margin"><strong>Project Manager</strong></p>
		<p>With a vibrant personality, big smile, and positive attitude to boot, Michael stands testament to a great truth - that the highest of high-performance homes can be built without having to check the fun at the door. Michael joined the Green Hammer team in July of 2006 and considers the crew to be his family away from family.</p>
		<p>As a project manager, he seamlessly connects the many pieces of the building process puzzle. He has several LEED-H Platinum homes under his tool belt, including the completion of the first gut rehab project to receive LEED-H Platinum certification in Oregon,<a href="http://www.tigardtimes.com/features/story.php?story_id=122419682322623100"> located in Metzger</a>. Of special note in his book are the earthen floors laid in <a href="portfolio/granger/portfolio.shtml">this NE home</a>.</p>
		<p>Though originally from Chicago, Michael's interest and experience as a framer blossomed out West. Before moving to Portland, Michael spent ten years exploring the mountains of Central Idaho, where he developed his craft and passion for all things natural. He was drawn further West to the great city of Portland in pursuit of culture and a building team that did things a little differently.</p>

		<p class="no_margin"><strong>Lead Finish Carpenter &amp; Cabinet Craftsman</strong></p>
		<p class="no_margin"><strong>Founder, Heart Felt Furniture &amp; Urban Timber Works</strong></p>
		<p>In the dictionary under the title 'Finish Carpenter' you should see a photo of Robert Wortman. When Robert first came on to the crew there was a human resource mishap. Initially working as a framer and doing great work, Robert mentioned his enthusiasm for finish by saying 'you've yet to see the true wrath of my hammer' - Well Robert you were right.</p>

		<p class="no_margin"><strong>Master Carpenter</strong></p>
		<p class="no_margin"><strong>Owner &amp; Founder, Urban Timber Works</strong></p>
		<p>When Joolz isn't walking on stilts, spinning and spitting fire he's making sure end grain meets end grain and knot's are strategically placed. Beyond being an excellent craftsman, few carpenters share Joolz's enthusiasm for ecological building, or his ability to breathe life back into salvaged materials. I knew Joolz was a perfect fit for Green Hammer when during his first week he was confronted with a pile of nail ridden splintered lumber and asked if he thought we could do anything with it, a light sparked in his eye, he grinned ear to ear, slapped his hands together and bellowed: &quot;Alright! Oh yeah, yeah, we can do a lot with this!&quot;</p>

		<p class="no_margin"><strong>Project Manager</strong></p>
		<p class="no_margin"><strong>BPI Certified TECH</strong></p>
		<p>The role of a project manager takes a new form each day - new challenges to solve and new hats to wear. It is this variation that Rob loves and finds exciting. Since joining the Green Hammer team in 2008 as a project manager, Rob has managed the completion of several new homes and remodels (<a href="portfolio/strid/portfolio.shtml">including this Net Zero Remodel</a>). His professional green building experience in combination with his steady ability to see the big picture has aided him in these projects.</p>
		<p>Rob has been swinging a hammer for most of his life. A native of New Jersey, Rob worked construction with his dad before attending Notre Dame University. After graduation he traveled around the country a while before settling in Berkeley, California. A quick leap up north found him back in Portland in search of a building company that matched his personal building philosophy.</p>
		<p>When not juggling the construction process at work, Rob stays active on the Ultimate Frisbee field. And sometimes can be found scaling rock outcrops, or hiking and exploring the great outdoors around the state.</p>

		<p class="no_margin"><strong>BPI Certified TECH</strong></p>
		<p>Andrew originally was hired on to Green Hammer in 2007 to take over as the lead framer. It wasn't long before his previous knowledge as a small business owner and contractor began to shine. Andrew has built the bones of many LEED-H platinum certified buildings for Green Hammer and in doing so developed his keen interest and knowledge in high performance construction. In 2008 Andrew began the formal education process that eventually allowed him to become a part of an elite group of Building Performance Institute (BPI) certified home performance technicians. He now is Green Hammer's lead technician and manages the Energy Crafters division of Green Hammer founded by Designer Jesse Schwartzberg.</p>

		<p class="no_margin"><strong>Designer &amp; Energy Specialist</strong></p>
		<p class="no_margin"><strong>M.Arch, LEED AP, BPI Certified TECH, Certified Passive House Consultant</strong></p>
		<p>Jesse wears a lot of hats at Green Hammer. Primarily, he is a designer and energy specialist but also chips in to do a bit of project coordination, carpentry, recycling, and anything else that makes the company flow. Jesse's strength lies in his ability to integrate his energy training and construction background into his designs. His holistic understanding renders him a creative force at Green Hammer.</p>
		<p>Jesse is a native of New York's Adirondack Mountains. So it goes without saying that he understands the imperative of a well-insulated home. He has spent the better part of the past decade on the West Coast, where he received his bachelor's degree in Earth Science from UC Berkeley and his Masters in Architecture degree from the University of Oregon.</p>
		<p>Additionally, he is a LEED AP and holds Building Performance Institute (BPI) certification, he utilizes this training to ensure that our homes meet the highest energy performance standards. Jesse can just as easily be seen in the office drawing plans as on the job site wielding his favorite tool - a thermal infrared camera. Though a hammer is a close second in the favorite tool category, as Jesse spent six years working as a carpenter before attending architecture school.</p>

While enrolled Dylan also worked at the Energy Studies in Buildings Laboratory under the direction of GZ “Charlie” Brown.

He is calm and cool throughout the design and build process, and before you know it, you'll be inviting him over for a beer on a regular basis!
